#The simple difference, $D_{i} − R_{i}$: this seems like a good transformation because is symmetric and centered at zero. One disadvantage of this transformation is that it's not proportional. For instance, if Democrats got $6M and Republicans just $4M the difference will be $2M. Now, in the hypothesis Democrats raised $3M and Republicans $1M the absolute difference will still be $2M. However, $2M in the first example corresponds to a much closed gap between the two parties than in the second example. This could limit the effectiveness of the predictor if districts differ widely in average money raised
#The ratio, $\frac{D_{i}}{R_{i}}$: this transformation has the disadvantage of being centered at 1 and that is asymmetric. In particualar it tends to zero for case where the Republics have more money raised than Democrats, and tend to infinity on the opposite case. This means that it will weight more cases where Democrats raised more money than the opposite party
#The difference on the logarithmic scale, $log(D_{i}) − log(R_{i})$: this is similar to the first transformation, with the difference that is less sensitive to outliers. It is centered to zero and is symmetric. Another advantage of this transformation is that is proportional to the magnitude of the difference. So a $2M difference between the parties on a county where each raise on average above $100M will have a lower value than the same diffence on a district where foundraising is poorer
#The relative proportion, $\frac{D_{i}}{D_{i} + R_{i}}$: this transformation is centered at 0.5 and symmetric
